  Trying proc_tes_2Feb.py,   as more recent attempts of combining Yilun's tes filtered TOD list with my feature set ran into trouble.  
  In this version of the code, I've got feature1, 2 and 3, plus the relatively new feature5, which is the weird ~60 sec filter in 
calculation.  I'll run this code overnight and generate feature data with which to try analysis.
  RESULT:   code timed out after 4 hours of running.
